1
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,643
Come on!

2
00:01:22,643 --> 00:01:24,083
I'm coming.

3
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,560
- Sawasdee krup.
- Sawasdee krup.

4
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,561
This is me, Tee. This is Mhok.

5
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:30,320
No! This is me, Mhok. And this is Tee.

6
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,302
No!

7
00:01:31,302 --> 00:01:33,041
- This is me, Mhok. This is Tee.
- No!

8
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:34,680
That's correct.

9
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,440
There's a comment asking
which of us has more stamina.

10
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,320
There's no question. It's me.

11
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,560
Yeah right.

12
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,400
Let's find out in this clip.

13
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,640
Tee-Mhok Got Talent.

14
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,760
Challenge!

15
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,760
Tee-Mhok Challenge.

16
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,760
We'll compete in 2 out of 3 games.

17
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,400
A loser will clean the bathroom.

18
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,080
- It mean I have to win 2 in 3 games, right?
- Right.

19
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
Our first game.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,360
Our first game. Push-up challenge.
The person who is out of energy first loses.

21
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,200
Are you done for?

22
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,800
- Let me have a look.
- Post-it dance.

23
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,120
I got none left.

24
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,160
Screw you!

25
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,400
The third game is eye contact challenge.

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,320
The person who blinks first loses.

27
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,120
We will hold water in our mouths in this challenge.

28
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,080
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I am. You?

29
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
I am so ready.

30
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,320
I'm the winner in this challenge.

32
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,800
You're a cheater.

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,480
How did I cheat?

34
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,160
- You splashed water at me.
- You're fine.

35
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,120
The score is... I've won: 2 against 1.

36
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,320
- You cheated.
- What?

37
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,440
You cheated.

38
00:03:27,477 --> 00:03:28,720
What are you doing?

39
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,200
Watching the clip I made.

40
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,320
Here's a key card to my dorm.

41
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,880
Now you can come in without calling me.

42
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,763
I haven't made one for you yet.
I'll do it when I have time.

43
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,570
I told you to move in with me...

44
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,680
so that we can save up.

45
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,965
It's better to stay at different places.

46
00:03:54,965 --> 00:03:57,280
I am considerate of your mom.

47
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,360
Oh yeah?

48
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,440
She's cool with you.

49
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,080
This way, we will have time to miss each other.

50
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:09,960
Are you sure?

51
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Or do you want to sneak someone into your room?

52
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,600
There's no one else; only you.

53
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,440
You're my regular.

54
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,760
That's right.

55
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,080
Make sure you know damn well who I am.

56
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,480
Who are you?

57
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,320
Oh, my boyfriend whom I love very much.

58
00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:32,400
Don't you ever stray,
or prepare to die if I find out.

59
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:02,480
Mhok! Wake up!

60
00:05:03,797 --> 00:05:07,203
This movie was fun.

61
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:08,720
Don't talk your way out of this.

62
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,240
I asked you to do something romantic,
but you were never into it.

63
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,561
I didn't fell asleep or anything.
The movie was so much fun.

64
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:21,363
We have tried to watch it three times.
You never finished it.

65
00:05:22,677 --> 00:05:24,680
Come here. No sulking.

66
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,360
Let me wash your hair.

67
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,920
This gets old, you know.

68
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,760
I'm gonna go home.

69
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,200
What? You said you'd stay with me tonight.

70
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,160
We won't have time to be together during exams.

71
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,520
If I stay here, we won't get any sleep.

72
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,720
You know what?

73
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,487
Econ exams are very difficult.

74
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:48,687
You study hard, okay?

75
00:05:50,037 --> 00:05:52,120
I'm going home.

76
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,120
- Bye.
- Bye.

77
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,920
Did you forget something?

78
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,746
Sweet dreams.

79
00:06:01,746 --> 00:06:03,320
Yes. Bye.

80
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
Bye.

81
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
Tee!

82
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
What?

83
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,000
[Tee,]

84
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,720
[Although I'm not always polite]

85
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
[I snore]

86
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,880
[I cheat]

87
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,320
[I tease]

88

[But]

89
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,960
[I do those things to you only]

90
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,800
[I may not be romantic]

91
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,720
[But I love you]

92
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
[My Tee]

93
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,440
Get home safe.

94
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,840
Mmm.

95
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,048
Thanks.

96
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,360
I'm ashamed that my family provides a laundry service.

97
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,549
Hey, Morn.

98
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:42,824
Are you here to see Mhok?

99
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:43,904
Hello.

100
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:48,480
Yes, Muad won a lottery.
He wants to treat everyone to a dinner.

101
00:08:49,939 --> 00:08:51,240
Do you want to come?

102
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,880
I can't.

103
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:55,884
I have plans with my mom.

104
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,624
It's good that you're here.

105
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:01,960
I have something I want to pick your brain about.

106
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,040
What?

107
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,800
Next weeks is our anniversary.

108
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
But I still don't know what I will do for Mhok.

109
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,640
Can you please help me out?

110
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:17,560
If you ask me, I'll say buy some flowers.

111
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,061
Buying flowers is not that special.

112
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,963
It's our third anniversary,
and I want to do something special for him.

113
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,320
My mind is blank right now.

114
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,280
If I can think of anything, I'll let you know.

115
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,880
Thanks so much, my dear brother.

116
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,560
Just one condition.

117
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,000
You can't tell anybody, not even Gord.

118
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,243
- Why?
- Can't tell anyone what?

119
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:57,163
That Tee cannot come with us tonight.

120
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,163
That's right.

121
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
I'm seeing my mom today.

122
00:10:03,997 --> 00:10:06,000
Tell Muad I'm sorry.

123
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,200
No problem.

124
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,080
Let's go.

125
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,071
- Already?
- We don't want to keep Muad waiting.

126
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:13,830
See you later.

127
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,480
Here's your bag.

128
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,240
See you later.

129
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,725
[3rd Anniversary]

[Favourites]
[Mhok]

131
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,320
[Mhok]

132
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,028
He has a romantic streak in him.

133
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Ton, do you have my pants?

134
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,859
You wore them the other day.

135
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:57,859
Ton.

136
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,040
This is Tee, not Ton.

137
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,960
Hey, Tee.

138
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,960
I was going to call you.

139
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,960
How's dinner with your mom? How is she?

140
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,120
What did she say? How about Lek?

141
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,520
You're not that smooth.

142
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,520
You called me by mistake. Just admit it.

143
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,840
I was really going to call you.

144
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,120
Not true. I usually am the one to call.

145
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,280
My boyfriend is so sensitive.

146
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,160
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning,
and we can go to the campus together.

147
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Please. Please. Please.

148
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,760
You make a mistake, and then you spoil me.

149
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Hey, Mhok.

150
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
What are you doing next Saturday?

151
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,760
Nothing. Why?

152
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,960
Nothing.

153
00:11:50,472 --> 00:11:51,872
Beautiful stars tonight.

154
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,080
How come I never look?

155
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,483
For things that are close to you,
you take them for granted.

156
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,920
But I never take you for granted.

157
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,960
I wish you were here with me
so we can watch the stars together.

158
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,000
Let me put you on the speaker.
I'll play the guitar for you.

159
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,240
I've just started learning.

160
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,160
♫ Tonight, there are millions of stars ♫

161
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,840
♫ But I have only your heart ♫

162
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,280
♫ We lock eyes when we're right next each other ♫

163
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,600
♫ I want to kiss my star under the moon ♫

164
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,840
Hey.

165
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,840
Luckily, you called me this morning.
I nearly almost forget about class today.

166
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,080
You promised to pick me up.
And I ended up giving you a morning call.

167
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,880
Oh. If there is no Tee,
I don't know where my life will go on.

168
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,778
You forget everything.

169
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:38,283
So do you remember what is next Saturday?

170
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:39,603
What?

171
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,848
You really don't remember?

172
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:48,600
It's the day...

173
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,800
It's the day you're going to Hong Kong
with Mama, right?

174
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,003
- You are joking, right?
- It's not. I'm sorry.

175
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,680
Weekend!

176
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,720
You don't have class that day, right?

177
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,480
Weekend? No class?

178
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,883
Right.

179
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,923
See? I'm right again.

180
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,000
Let's go!

181
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
Bro.

182
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,840
About the anniversary... I've got a plan.

183
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,693
- Test him?
- Yes, test him.

184
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:40,709
Look at this clip.

185
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:43,200
The guy acts like he's cheating on the girl.

186
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,021
When the girl finds out, she gets mad
and goes up to his apartment to confront him.

187
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:49,701
Then, she's in for a surprise
as the guy proposes to her.

188
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:53,101
You gotta do this. It will work.

189
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:58,269
Trust me, this is the best way.

190
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,690
Good, I've got an idea.

191
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,216
N? Who added me?

192
00:15:20,216 --> 00:15:21,216
Mhok.

193
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,325
Hey, Nair.

194
00:15:32,838 --> 00:15:34,838
He's not replying. Good job.

195
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:45,409
Is it expensive? Not much, right?

196
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:47,492
No charge. You're my friend.

197
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,040
I've got to go. Let's chat more on Line.

198
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,640
Sure. I'll tell my friends.

199
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,063
You got it.

200
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,029
Hi, there.

201
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
Who's that?

202
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:13,267
A senior.

203
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:15,858
She's pretty.

204
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:19,179
Shall we get going?

205
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,520
Where to?

206
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,643
Seriously, is there anything in your memory?

207
00:16:23,643 --> 00:16:25,483
To exercise.

208
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:28,520
Don't you remember what your dad said?

209
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,000
Even though you're not sick anymore,
you need to exercise.

210
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,640
Fine, Mom.

211
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,240
- Take it.
- You're so sweet you brought these for me.

212
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,000
How many laps should we run?

213
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,500
- 1000 laps.
- No.

214
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,160
I'll have tuition after class.
A senior has offered to tutor me.

215
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,680
I won't have a lot of free time as I used to.

216
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,760
It's good that you're studying hard.
My mom likes a hardworking student.

217
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,720
That's what I am.

218
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,920
Don't wait for me when I have tuition.
I'll let you know once I'm home.

219
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,720
You gave that excuse pretty quickly.

220
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,800
- I know I have a jealous boyfriend.
- It's good that you know it.

221
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,763
Who's the tutor? Is it a boy or a girl?

222
00:17:06,763 --> 00:17:08,930
You wanna know, huh? You gotta catch me first.

223
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,640
Are you gonna tell me?

224
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,840
No!

225
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:43,375
I'm going to bed. Sweet dreams.

226
00:17:52,023 --> 00:17:53,744
Sweet dreams.

227
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:05,117
Why did he read it?

228
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,803
Great! I'm in!

229
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:09,168
You don't have to be so loud.

230
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:10,281
I'm just so excited.

231
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:15,211
You can't tell anyone about this, especially Morn.

232
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:18,200
But he's your brother.

233
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,400
He's got a big mouth, and he's nosey.

234
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,240
If he knows, the world knows.

235
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,480
Don't say anything bad about Morn.

236
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,880
You're so sweet.

237
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,480
It makes me sick.

238
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,880
The plan is that...

239
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,000
Morn comes to the campus a lot these days.

240
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,360
I don't know why he comes here,
but I want you to help me keep him away.

241
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,600
Sure thing, Bro.

242
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
He's my boy. I can manage him.

243
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,024
That's why I asked you.

244
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,283
You put the right man on the right job.

245
00:18:49,283 --> 00:18:50,323
Let's go.

246
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,840
I don't know why he's so clingy to me.

247
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,520
Take care of it.

248
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,080
Hello.

249
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,440
Hey, Gord. What brings you here?

250
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,680
I'm here to see you.

251
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,320
I know that you followed Mhok here,
so I followed you.

252
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:14,529
Is something wrong?

253
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:17,880
I just wanted to ask you to grab something to eat.

254
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,000
You? Asking me to grab something to eat?

255
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:22,800
What's got into you?

256
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,280
I'm just in a good mood.

257
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,283
Let's go. My treat.

258
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:29,323
Hold on. Let's wait for Mhok.

259
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:32,680
We can go now. He can catch up with us later.

260
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,305
Come on, let's go.

261
00:19:35,305 --> 00:19:37,320
You gotta come with me. I'm buying.

262
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,923
- OK, let's go.
- Yes.

263
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:43,040
Are you alright?

264
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,280
I am fine.

265
00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:49,360
- Extravagant.
- Can you add one more?

266
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,000
- Who?
- Me.

267
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,720
Make it two.

268
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,043
It's time. Let's go.

269
00:19:54,043 --> 00:19:55,643
- OK.
- Let's go.

270
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,280
- Is it expensive?
- Three times the standard price.

271
00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:01,720
What?

272
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,845
[Mom]

273
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:32,904
Hello, Mom.

274
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,280
I know.

275
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,316
Mhok?

276
00:20:41,316 --> 00:20:44,880
He's not coming. He has tuition.

277
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,160
OK, Mom. See you.

278
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,120
Follow me.

279
00:21:09,317 --> 00:21:13,713
Everyone, let me introduce Nong Mhok.

280
00:21:13,713 --> 00:21:15,840
Sawasdee krup.

281
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,000
Sawasdee.

282
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,560
He wants to ask us to do him a favor.

283
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,920
Tell them.

284
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
So cute.

285
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,904
Mhok and Tee are so cute together.

286
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:53,189
Shall we do a clip to go up against them?

287
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:54,504
Let's do it.

288
00:21:54,504 --> 00:21:56,992
What should be the name of our clip?

289
00:21:56,992 --> 00:21:58,992
Gord Morn or Morn Gord.

290
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,923
I don't know.

291
00:22:01,923 --> 00:22:04,263
I get to hug you either way.

292
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,760
Hello, Muad.

293
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,480
Oh yeah?

294
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,000
OK, catch up soon.

295
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,080
Bye.

296
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,640
I have to go.

297
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,960
I'll see you later.

298
00:22:36,997 --> 00:22:40,960
That's fine. You don't need to come with me.
I'm good going by myself.

299
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,640
Okay, see you.

300
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,760
See you.

301
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
Bro, Morn is gone.

302
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,880
Mhok!

303
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,080
This is cool. I want to play, too.

304
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:27,440
Guys, this is my friend, Nong Gord.
He'll give us a hand.

305
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,600
Sawasdee krup.

306
00:23:30,596 --> 00:23:32,920
- This is Nair.
- Hi.

307
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,720
What will you help us with?

308
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,440
Is there anything cool that I can play?

309
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,683
- Something cool?
- Yes.

310
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,120
Sarun, give him the cymbals.

311
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,640
Awesome!

312
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:55,400
Give him the equipment, too.

313
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,320
Polish the symbols until they shine.

314
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,480
You won't do anything else until they do.

315
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,560
Take these. This is so cool.

316
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,440
- Mhok, you can practice over there.
- OK. Thanks.

317
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Try to look cool when you polish them.

318
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,320
[N sent you a sticker]

319
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,800
Mhok!

320
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,440
Mhok!

321
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,241
What?

322
00:24:33,241 --> 00:24:34,680
Someone sent you a Line message.

323
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,240
Who is it?

324
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,240
I don't know. The name is N.

325
00:24:38,997 --> 00:24:41,320
I don't know that person. You reply.

326
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,400
What should I say?

327
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,083
He said he's busy with tuition
How can he find the time to reply?

328
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,040
Mhok, what are you doing?

329
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,040
Mhok!

330
00:25:18,154 --> 00:25:20,440
- Mhok!
- What?

331
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,857
Tee sent you a message.

332
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,880

370
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,680
He didn't reply to my message but texted Nuknik.

Nuknik who?

372
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,180
It's my fake account.

373

I created it to test Mhok.

374
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,043
You test him, and you end up getting jealous.

375

Tee, I don't think he's that type of person.

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,720
What?

504
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,800
It's hot outside. Let's go inside.

505
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,520
I don't want to.

506
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,760
I don't want to.

507
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,320
Don't drag me.

508
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,600
Come on.

509
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,240
You will break up with your boyfriend.

510
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:45,167
You have to get rid of the bad luck
before it's too late.

511
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:49,960
I told you we would have bad luck.

512
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,683
I told you we would have bad luck.

513
00:46:53,683 --> 00:46:55,243
That's a sign of bad luck.

514
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:07,320
But you like to talk back at me.

515
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,040
- Look who's talking.
- You are talking back at me.

516
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,253
- No, you are.
- No, you are.

517
00:47:10,253 --> 00:47:11,693
This is annoying. We both are.

518
00:47:14,713 --> 00:47:16,713
I just want this day to be special.
