00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:45,319
to pretend that you have been dead and born again.

168
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,960
Has this shroud been used?

169
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,080
Yes, it has.

170
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,920
But don't worry.
I've already washed all body fluid stains.

171
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,440
Thank you.

172
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,296
Damn it, Kao. I'm not gonna do this. It's gross.

173
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:06,991
Come on.

174
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:09,281
It's clear that she is kidding.

175
00:15:09,281 --> 00:15:11,561
This is no kidding. There's a smell from it.

176
00:15:12,526 --> 00:15:15,561
Trust me. She is just kidding.

177
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:16,722
You are kidding, right?

178
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:18,444
Shall we start?

179
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,202
- Start with him.
- Damn it, Kao.

180
00:15:22,202 --> 00:15:23,720
Give me a sec.

181
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,265
Please lie down. We don't have all day.

182
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:27,320
Go lie down.

183
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,161
You do it first. You want to do this, not me.

184
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,161
Go ahead.

185
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,880
Hurry up. Don't waste time.

186
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:38,979
You asshole.

187
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Kao.

188
00:15:56,308 --> 00:15:57,308
Kao!

189
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:01,499
Kao!

190
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:02,740
What's up?

191
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,860
Are you still there?

192
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,058
I'm talking to you.

193
00:16:07,058 --> 00:16:09,339
How long do you have to stay in here?

194
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:12,452
- I didn't know. I forgot to ask.
- What?

195
00:16:12,452 --> 00:16:14,714
Did you trick me to do this for your pleasure?

196
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:18,825
Give me a break. I'm being tied too.

197
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
Kao.

198
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,360
Kao.

199
00:16:25,097 --> 00:16:27,818
Just stay quiet and pretend to
be like a dead man for a while.

200
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:29,218
She will untie us soon.

201
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,680
So gross.

202
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:42,720
Pete!

203
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,991
Why? Do you like to pretend to be dead that much?

204
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:46,480
Why don't you just go die for real?

205
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,720
Pucker your lips.

206
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,400
Do you want to reborn yet?

207
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,681
Get up now.

208
00:16:50,681 --> 00:16:53,041
Are you going to be here for a whole week
and get cremated?

209
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,511
Get up!

210
00:16:55,511 --> 00:16:56,511
Pete!

211
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:03,225
Shit!

212
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:05,108
I'm so sorry. Why didn't you tell me?

213
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,188
I did!

214
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,480
Hurry up.

215
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,080
You should know that I don't like to be confined.

216
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,560
I just knew.

217
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,440
And I just knew that
you like to flick people's dick too.

218
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,040
How the hell would I know?

219
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,600
Come on. You did that on purpose, didn't you?

220
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,360
Stop talking or I'll flick yours now.

221
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,280
Flick what? Go ahead. Go ahead.

222
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,840
- Do it!
- I'll flick your forehead!

223
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,280
You forgot your thing.

224
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,321
- Thank you.
- Give it to me.

225
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,179
You are forgetful again.

226
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:48,581
What about you?
You forgot this and that since morning.

227
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:50,640
- What did I forget?
- You want me to name them?

228
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:57,533
What? I'm not gonna hold your hand.

229
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,520
This is absurd.

230
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,560
Let's get going.

231
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,560
Enough. Let go of me already.

232
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,160
Just go without me.

233
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
We are nearly there. Come on.

234
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
What is it?

235
00:19:22,882 --> 00:19:24,283
Let's take a break here. I'm exhausted.

236
00:19:24,283 --> 00:19:26,742
Come on. We almost make it.

237
00:19:26,742 --> 00:19:28,280
Make what?

238
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,398
999 meters.
[7. Take a stroll for 999 meters]

239
00:19:30,398 --> 00:19:32,838
We have already walked
way more than that since we left home.

240
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,600
We need to restart the counter.

241
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,695
No, I'm done.

242
00:19:38,695 --> 00:19:41,216
I have to carry this orange tree and it's heavy.

243
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:42,566
And my shirt is dirty.

244
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:46,080
Then leave it here. We can come back for it later.

245
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,200
Someone could take it?

246
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,120
- The orange tree?
- Hell yeah.

247
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,440
Didn't you say it could make us richer?

248
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,480
If you leave it here, don't you think
someone might want to steal it?

249
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,117
The stealer can buy this himself.
It's not that expensive.

250
00:19:58,117 --> 00:20:00,214
Get up. Let's continue walking.

251
00:20:01,418 --> 00:20:02,699
Come on.

252
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,720
Take it with you.

253
00:20:33,694 --> 00:20:34,920
What are we here?

254
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,360
To watch a movie.
[8. Watch a movie]

255
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,303
Watching a movie can remove bad luck?

256
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,240
Let's find something to eat too. I'm hungry.

257
00:21:12,152 --> 00:21:13,360
Hey, Kao.

258
00:21:14,617 --> 00:21:16,298
Let me ask you something.

259
00:21:16,298 --> 00:21:19,818
On the list, I didn't see anything
that normal people do.

260
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,960
I think it's strange.

261
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
Strange?

262
00:21:28,016 --> 00:21:29,377
I don't think it is strange?

263
00:21:29,377 --> 00:21:30,978
Don't you agree?

264
00:21:30,978 --> 00:21:35,378
Normally people go to make merits
and wish in a temple to remove bad luck.

265
00:21:37,282 --> 00:21:38,363
Yes.

266
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,923
Why don't we do it like that too?

267
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,440
It's not a good time to do that today.

268
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,680
Are you serious?

269
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,660
Then you also believe that
we must not tap the plate while eating?

270
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:56,489
No nail cutting at the nighttime?

271
00:21:57,564 --> 00:21:59,084
No hair washing on Thursday?

272
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,880
Thursday rhymes with "not good to wash hair".

273
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,280
Not good my butt!

274
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,240
Shush, focus on the screen.

275
00:23:22,427 --> 00:23:24,239
Hey, Kao.

276
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:26,599
You are walking to that black cat.
Aren't you afraid of it?

277
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Oh, the black cat.

278
00:23:31,338 --> 00:23:34,498
A superstitious person like you
should be afraid of a black cat.

279
00:23:35,572 --> 00:23:38,452
Yes, you got a point.

280
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,800
What should we do now?

281
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:44,683
Just step back. That's not hard.

282
00:23:44,683 --> 00:23:46,532
Just step back. That's not hard.

283
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,600
5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

284
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,761
- Are we 999 meters yet?
- Not yet.

285
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:02,485
You want to be a hero?

286
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,430
Calm down, Pete.

287
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,880
No, Pete.

288
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,520
Stop it.

289
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,680
Calm down.

290
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,361
- He hit me first.
- Just calm down.

291
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:24,332
What the hell is wrong with you?
Why did you stop me?

292
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:27,403
If I didn't, and things get out of hand

293
00:24:27,403 --> 00:24:29,598
you may end up with more injuries.

294
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:31,598
We are down on luck at the moment.

295
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:35,020
If you didn't butt in, it would be their bad luck.

296
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,901
Yes, I butt in to stop you because I care!

297
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,080
So, what's next?

298
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,920
You are so concerned about removing bad luck.
What's next on the list?

299
00:24:49,493 --> 00:24:50,720
Say it now.

300
00:25:01,075 --> 00:25:02,395
Tell the truth.

301
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,930
Tell the truth.

302
00:25:14,261 --> 00:25:15,701
Just say what you have in your mind.

303
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,782
- Come on. Say it.
- Okay, I'm lying.

304
00:25:21,782 --> 00:25:23,000
About what?

305
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,200
Everything.

306
00:25:26,897 --> 00:25:28,080
What do you mean?

307
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:32,987
I'm lying about everything.

308
00:25:35,973 --> 00:25:37,623
There is no removing-bad-luck thingy.

309
00:25:38,893 --> 00:25:40,373
The old lady didn't tell me to do it.

310
00:25:45,308 --> 00:25:46,628
We are not fated to break up.

311
00:25:54,004 --> 00:25:56,725
Listen, I will bring you to a Chinese temple with me.

312
00:25:56,725 --> 00:26:00,765
I help you remove your bad luck,
so you can get a husband of your own.

313
00:26:02,065 --> 00:26:04,825
Push me gently. How many times do I have to tell you?

314
00:26:32,963 --> 00:26:34,964
Why did you trick me into believing it?

315
00:26:34,964 --> 00:26:36,845
I was involved in a fight.

316
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,406
You looked for trouble on your own.
That was not on the list.

317
00:26:39,406 --> 00:26:40,845
Didn't you care to tell me first?

318
00:26:41,578 --> 00:26:43,760
I thought if we could go out
and do some crazy things together,

319
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,056
you would be very surprised to know the truth later.

320
00:26:48,377 --> 00:26:50,537
Yes, I was fucking surprised.

321
00:26:56,884 --> 00:26:58,040
I'm sorry.

322
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,094
Don't get mad at me.

323
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,960
I have been trying to tell you.

324
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,240
But I don't dare to.

325
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:27,000
♫ At the end of the day, we both get hurt ♫

326
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,880
♫ If this doesn't work, why do we have to suffer? ♫

327

what do we stay mad for? ♫

330
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,240
Pete.

331
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,948
Don't be mad at me.

332
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,080
I really have tried to tell you, but I dare not.

333
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,987
I'm so freaking pissed off at you, you know?

334
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,440
I'm sorry.

335
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,868
Why the hell did I bring it with me?

336
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,820
Here.

337
00:29:35,634 --> 00:29:37,355
- What?
- Let me see.

338
00:29:42,456 --> 00:29:43,600
Easy, easy!

339
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,920
I'm sorry.

340
00:29:52,978 --> 00:29:54,769
I just wanted today to be special.

341
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:02,857
It was my fault. I forgot that my boyfriend
likes to pick up fights when he's outside.

342
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,905
I almost stop being mad at you,
but I'm still am a bit.

343
00:30:07,905 --> 00:30:09,906
A bit of what?

344
00:30:09,906 --> 00:30:10,906
It hurts!

345
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,800
Don't pretend you don't know.

346
00:30:15,497 --> 00:30:16,818
You are not mad at me now.

347
00:30:16,818 --> 00:30:19,018
No, I am still mad at you.
Get the hell out of my face.

348
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:22,680
Look, you are smiling.

349
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,681
I'm not.

350
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:26,081
- You are smiling.
- Who is smiling?

351
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
What?

352
00:30:30,443 --> 00:30:33,640
There's still one more thing to do. Remember?

353
00:30:37,025 --> 00:30:38,338
You are not going to stop?

354
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,160
Let's do it. I remember too.

355
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,400
Don't just talk the talk...

356
00:31:03,115 --> 00:31:04,446
How were my lips?

357
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
So-so.

358
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,000
I need to do it one more time.

359
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,960
Enough.

360
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,600
- Why? You are the one who wants to do it.
- You are so naughty.

361
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,563
You even wrote it down on the list.

362
00:31:15,563 --> 00:31:18,241
Stop being shy. It's not our first.

363
00:31:21,282 --> 00:31:23,881
- Should we write more?
- What are you talking about?

364
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:25,920
How to remove bad luck.

365
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,282
We don't have bad luck now.

366
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,040
Stop your nonsense.

367
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,520
What?

368
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,200
You're heavy.

369
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,880
Just one kiss and you forgot to take it with you.

370
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:30,240
It's good that I didn't throw it away
in the middle of the road.

371
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,057
Sit down.

372
00:32:32,057 --> 00:32:33,373
Don't order me.

373
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:53,120
How is it today? Is it as special as you wish?

374
00:32:57,771 --> 00:32:58,771
Well...

375
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,120
Well... I guess.

376
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:07,698
Why are you smiling? Do you want me to punch you?

377
00:33:07,698 --> 00:33:09,698
If you punch me, I will kiss you back.

378
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:13,109
You're so gonna get it.

379
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Hey, Kao.

380
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,360
I have something to tell you.

381
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,360
What is it?

382
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,880
I knew from the beginning
that you were fooling me about the old lady.

383
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,960
From the beginning?

384
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,680
From the time you held my face
to look at you on the bus.

385
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,200
You were strange then.

386
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,800
You can't look at me like this when you drive, right?

387
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:02,840
Stop bugging me.

388
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,320
Aren't you shy now?

389
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,320
- Why should I be?
- So many people in the back.

390
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,240
Here. Now your left eye twitched too.

391
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,402
They are even now.

392
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,120
Why did you bother to lie?

393
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,120
If you told me the truth at the start,
you wouldn't need to make all those up.

394
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,240
If I told you directly,
would you want to go out with me?

395
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,520
How do you know that I wouldn't?

396
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,800
If I want to hold your hand every hour like today,

397
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,160
you will keep finding excuses
and I won't get to do it.

398
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,080
So I had to make that up
in order to hold your hand.

399
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,960
I never find excuses to avoid holding your hand,
but you like to talk back at me.

400
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,520
Look who's talking. You are talking back at me.

401
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,000
- No, you are.
- No, you are.

402
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,840
This is annoying. What do you get
from making things up?

403
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,920
I get to be with you.

404
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,640
Fine.

405
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
You can tell me directly from now on.

406
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,000
I will try to not talk back at you.

407
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,000
Listen, my dear audiences.

408
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,520
It's common for couples to fight and bicker.

409
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,360
I have seen so many couples who fight a lot.

410
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,560
Next thing you know, you see them have two babies.

411
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,320
It makes me realize no matter
how many fights they have,

412
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,600
it's really obvious that
they love and care about each other.

413
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:12,440
Lastly, I would like to give this song to
all loving couples who fight and make up.

414
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,360
I hope your love lasts for a long time,

415
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,800
fight with your hands, never a weapon.

416
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,840
♫ We only have each other ♫

417
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,000
♫ We have been together
for so long to understand ♫

418
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,600
♫ sometimes, love is a pain in our hearts ♫

421
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,240
♫ why do we still put up with each other ♫

422
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,720
♫ and love even we always fight ♫

423

♫ It's just a pity matter, learn to let it go ♫

00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,680
♫ Even though you are still mad ♫

425

♫ Our love is like this

428
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,240
♫ Sometimes you step over the line ♫

429

♫ but I can manage to accept it ♫

430
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,720
♫ Sometimes I step over the line too,

431
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,040
♫ I can find a way to forgive you ♫

432
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:44,280

439
00:38:25,124 --> 00:38:27,044
Hey, Kongpob. We are at the airport.

440
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,640
I heard that the full scholarship is very hard to get.

441
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,720
Well, I have a good tutor.

442
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,880
Thank you for all your support.

443
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,881
You're thanking me again.

444
00:38:40,881 --> 00:38:42,333
I love you, you know?

445
00:38:43,302 --> 00:38:45,440
- When are you leaving for China?
- At the end of this month.
