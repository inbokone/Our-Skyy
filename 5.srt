1
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920
Wake up!

2
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,040
What time is it now?

3
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,160
It's 6-ish.

4
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,280
Just 6 o'clock.

5
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,183
Why did you wake up so early?
Usually, you wake up at 7 o'clock.

6
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,080
Today is the announcement date
of your scholarship result.

7
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,338
Aren't you excited to know?

8
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,200
The result won't come out until 12 pm.

9
00:02:24,085 --> 00:02:25,495
It's still hours away.

10
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:28,880
You seem to be more excited than I am.

11
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,560
I'm your tutor.

12
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,360
I want...

13
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,245
to know the outcome of my tutoring.

14
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,087
You are excited because you have no confidence
in your teaching?

15
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:50,087
Um.

16
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
Just kidding.

17
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,640
Arthit.

18
00:03:03,337 --> 00:03:05,400
Thank you for everything.

19
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Hey!

20
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,960
Your eyebrows are knitted together.

21
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:15,807
Kongpob, have some rest if you are tired.

22
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,800
Arthit, if I get the scholarship, will you be happy?

23
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,920
Sure. You know why?

24
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,240
Because I will get the whole bed to myself.

25
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,320
Hey.

26
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,440
Have I been making you feel uncomfortable?

27
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,880
Come on. I was just kidding.

28
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,200
Why so serious?

29
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,720
I will definitely be happy for you
because it's your dream.

30
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,800
But if it makes you miss me, I won't go.

31
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,920
Are you out of your mind?
You want to give up your dream because of me?

32
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
I'm not okay.

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,280
Come to think of it, I will be away for two years.

34
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,160
I'm sure you will miss me so badly
by just the first year.

35
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,160
I don't think the person
who suffers from missing someone is me.

36
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,480
It's you.

37
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,680
Why do you know me so well?

38
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,643
How long have we been together? How can I not know?

39
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:19,400
Let me tell you something.

40
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,480
If you do get the scholarship,

41
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,120
I will be the last person who sees you off
at the terminal's entrance gate.

42
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,680
Let's get going.

43
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,640
- Can I consider that a promise?
- Yes.

44
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,123
I didn't do anything much. You don't need to thank me.

45
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,080
I should take a shower now.

46
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,920
You can stay in bed. It's yours.

47
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,520
Wait a minute, Arthit.

48
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,320
You must be responsible for waking me up this early.

49
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,838
We have one hour till the usual time I wake up.

50
00:05:09,997 --> 00:05:12,120
Just leave it there. I'll clear it for you.

51
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,534
You better hurry to work.

52
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,160
Okay, thank you.

53
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,560
Hey, Kongpob.

54
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,440
Once you hear the result, you must tell me right away.

55
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,360
I won't tell you.

56
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,456
Will you tell me or not?

57
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
Okay, I'll tell you.

58
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,800
Good. I'll get going now.

59
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,240
- Don't forget your stuff.
- Okay.

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
See you.

61
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,760
Hello, Dad.

62
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,760
Is today your scholarship result day?

63
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,200
How is it going, son?

64
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,320
It's not out yet, Dad.
It should be available to check around noon.

65
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,680
Don't be sad if you don't get the scholarship.

66
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,149
You can further your study in the US
like we discussed.

67
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What's up, Arthit?

68
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,520
Yong, sawasdee krap.

69
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,643
Taking a break?

70
00:06:39,643 --> 00:06:41,640
Yes, I'm here to buy coffee.

71
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,953
I'll be back with you soon.

72
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,800
[Kongpob]
Excuse me, can I have an iced coffee?

73
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,400
Hello, Kongpob?

74
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,560
Arthit, about the result...

75
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,080
You got it, right? You got the scholarship, right?

76
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,280
Yes, I got it.

77
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,800
That's really awesome, Kongpob!

78
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,080
I'm happy for you. I'm really happy for you.

79
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,602
Thank you so much, Arthit.

80
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,600
So...

81
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,480
do you want to eat anything especially tonight?

82
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,040
Well, anything is fine.

83
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,840
Whatever you make, I'll just have it.

84
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,587
Okay.

85
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:19,587
Well then,

86
00:07:20,717 --> 00:07:22,320
see you tonight.

87
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,600
Okay, see you.

88
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,450
[Congratulation. You application
has been successfully submitted.]

89
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,120
Kongpob, come up to the rooftop.

90
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,120
Surprise!

91
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,482
What is this, Arthit?

92
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,170
Just like what you see.
A surprise from me. Do you like it?

93
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,480
Anything good happened to you?
Why do you look so happy?

94
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,994
Ah, it's Kongpob. He just got a scholarship
to study in China.

95
00:08:41,994 --> 00:08:43,120
Really?

96
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,920
I knew it. I always knew that he is something.

97
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,600
Tell Kongpob that I'm really happy for him.

98
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,200
Sure, I'll tell him.

99
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,760
Sorry, I've got to go now. I'll talk to you later.

100
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,640
Yong, wait.

101
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,463
I want to have a surprise for Kongpob.

102
00:08:59,463 --> 00:09:01,463
Do you have any idea?

103
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:04,400
I can't think of one, right now.

104
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,840
I'll text you if I have an idea.

105
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,123
Thank you.

106
00:09:08,123 --> 00:09:09,264
See you.

107
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,803
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

108
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:39,363
Hey, Prem. Are you free this evening? I need a favor.

109
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,017
I'll take care of the rest.

110
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:48,017
See you, pal.

111
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:14,213
Time really flies.

112
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,400
Many of us have separated to their own ways.

113
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,963
Now, Kong is going to China to study too.

114
00:10:18,963 --> 00:10:21,926
M has just gone and now Kong.

115
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:25,289
Kong will be studying in economics
like he has dreamed of.

116
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:27,320
I heard it is difficult to get this scholarship.

117
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,640
Yes.

118
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,360
I'm jealous of you. He's not only handsome but smart.

119
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,260
- Why are you jealous of me?
- He's smart and handsome.

120
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,200
Hey, Kong. I heard that the full scholarship
is very hard to get.

121
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,720
Do you have any tips to share?

122
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes, how did you do it?
I want to apply it to my study.

123
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,560
Well, I have a good tutor.

124
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:50,960
I'm thirsty all of a sudden.

125
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,960
Hey, Kong.

126
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,723
When will you go? I may be able to see you off.

127
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:57,960
Come on, Oak.

128
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,480
You sound so cold.

129
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,640
Are you that busy?

130
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,960
Yes, I'm quite busy.

131
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:07,738
But I can always make time for friends.

132
00:11:08,691 --> 00:11:10,091
So, when are you leaving for China?

133
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,326
At the end of this month.

134
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
What?

135
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,843
- Why is it so soon?
- Yes, so soon.

136
00:11:21,677 --> 00:11:26,600
Anyway, let's celebrate for Kongpob today.

137
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,480
Come on. Another round of toast.

138
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,960
For the 75th time!

139
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,240
Cheers!

140
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,480
You will be gone for a long time.

141
00:11:52,798 --> 00:11:55,120
You just found out about that too, didn't you?

142
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,916
That Kongpob is leaving at the end of this month.

143
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:57,916
Yeah.

144
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,092
I think he was trying to find a way to tell me too.

145
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,388
What will you do?

146
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,040
I don't know.

147
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,480
It's too sudden.

148
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
Hey, Prem.

149
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,120
If you really love someone,

150
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,840
and you know that you have to break up
with that person one day,

151
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,240
what will you do?

152
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,443
I guess I just have to break up.

153
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:44,723
We have to end it anyway, right?

154
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,080
It's a waste of time. Don't you think?

155
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,680
Don't tell me you are going to break up with Kongpob?

156
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
No.

157
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,320
I'm just curious.

158
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Arthit.

159
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,120
About the traveling date,

160
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,510
I'm sorry for not telling you in advance.

161
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,802
Hey, it's all right. I understand.

162
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:33,765
You just knew about it too, didn't you?

163
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:35,325
It was too fast for me too.

164
00:13:37,202 --> 00:13:41,141
Even it was just a few hours ago.
Everything seems to be a rush.

165
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,760
It's gonna be fine. Trust me.

166
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
Thank you.

167
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,440
You're thanking me again.

168
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:01,849
Well, I want to thank you...

169
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,202
for understanding me and
also planning this surprise party.

170
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,200
Stop.

171
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,320
Once you start, you can't stop, huh?

172
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,560
Come on, Arthit.

173
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:26,520
I'm taking these down first.

174
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,868
Take those bottles down.

175
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:13,153
You also prepared a surprise for me?

176
00:15:15,274 --> 00:15:17,237
At first, it was just dinner.

177
00:15:17,237 --> 00:15:20,640
Then, I felt like I want to do
something a bit more special.

178
00:15:21,698 --> 00:15:24,984
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

179
00:15:24,984 --> 00:15:26,627
I asked those people to come.

180
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:28,350
You don't need to say sorry.

181
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:32,713
What I did for you today
is far from what you had done for me.

182
00:15:33,627 --> 00:15:35,415
You always know what I wanted.

183
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,720
You brought my friends to see me.
Thank you so much.

184
00:15:41,434 --> 00:15:46,277
Seriously, I heard a lot of "thank you" from you.

185
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,954
Enough of that. I want to get a shower now.

186
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,928
[Thank you for everything]

187
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:32,147
Arthit.

188
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,733
There's one more thing.

189
00:16:35,637 --> 00:16:39,840
I have to go home to prepare my document.

190
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,640
Tonight would be my last night here.

191
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:43,920
Okay.

192
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:47,006
I'm sure we will see each other again.

193
00:16:49,672 --> 00:16:51,233
Are you going to sleep yet?

194
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,326
I want to sleep now.

195
00:16:55,545 --> 00:16:57,115
I go turn off the light, then.

196
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,880
Goodnight, Arthit.

197
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,440
Goodnight, Kongpob.

198
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:09,491
I didn't hear the alarm clock.

199
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,561
What time is it now?

200
00:18:13,098 --> 00:18:14,248
Not 7 o'clock yet.

201
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
Why did you wake up so early?

202
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:23,244
Why don't you go back to sleep?

203
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:25,244
I need to pack. I haven't started yet.

204
00:18:34,151 --> 00:18:36,139
Do you need a hand?

205
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:37,139
Thank you.

206
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,800
I can finish the rest.

207
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,680
You should rather take a shower
and get yourself ready for work.

208
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,680
I'll make you breakfast.

209
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:09,698
Okay.

210
00:19:58,793 --> 00:20:00,956
Wow, what did you make? Smell so good.

211
00:20:00,956 --> 00:20:03,030
Stir-fried basil, clear soup and steamed egg.

212
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,750
Why don't you sit down and eat with me?

213
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:15,379
Let me get you soy milk first.

214
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,320
Kongpob, I have to go to work now.

215
00:20:39,915 --> 00:20:43,198
I spent too much time on eating.
I should have helped you pack.

216
00:20:44,186 --> 00:20:46,709
It's okay. You can go to work.

217
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,680
Well, I'm heading out, then.

218
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:00,298
Kongpob,

219
00:21:01,043 --> 00:21:02,238
if there's anything,

220
00:21:03,114 --> 00:21:04,324
don't forget to call me.

221
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,370
Okay.

222
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:09,543
Arthit.

223
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,770
What? I could be late for work.

224
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,610
I will take it out on you if I'm late.

225
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:37,402
I read this somewhere...

226
00:21:38,675 --> 00:21:41,363
that you never know
when it will be the last hug with someone.

227
00:21:44,142 --> 00:21:46,746
So you should always make
the most of your time together.

228
00:21:55,338 --> 00:21:59,453
Hey, don't make it too emotional.

229
00:21:59,453 --> 00:22:00,637
I'm going now.

230
00:23:22,757 --> 00:23:24,358
What are you thinking of?

231
00:23:24,358 --> 00:23:25,917
Nothing.

232
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:26,960
Get up.

233
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,520
Break time is nearly over. Let's get back to work.

234
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,535
Don't forget to see me off at the airport.

235
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,280
Have you woken up yet?

236
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,360
I have.

237
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,560
What about you?

238
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,240
I have been up for a while now.

239
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,800
I need to go out and hand over the document today.

240
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,087
Don't forget to eat something before going to work.

241
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,080
Got it, sir.

242
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,283
Listen, I can take care of myself.

243
00:25:55,283 --> 00:25:56,829
I'm not a child, you know?

244
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,960
Arthit.

245
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Yes?

246
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,800
Can you come and see me tonight?

247
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,240
Arthit.

248
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,803
Arthit.

249
00:26:14,803 --> 00:26:16,111
You totally zoned out.

250
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,840
- Hey, Prem.
- What's up?

251
00:26:22,837 --> 00:26:27,320
Why do you think Namwan and Jane broke up?

252
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Namwan went to study in the US.

253
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,320
Didn't you say long distance
is not the problem in relationship?

254
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,680
Why do many couples break up because of this?

255
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,083
There could be other reasons too.

256
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,723
What else could it be?

257
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,320
Well, it's true many couples
have broken up because of this.

258
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,960
But between you and Kongpob,
this is likely to be the reason to break up.

259
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,400
Distance is important,

260
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,480
but it depends on you and him.

261
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,374
How much can you stay true to your love?

262
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,600
Do you really think like that?

263
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,520
My thinking does not matter.
It's solely up to you and Kongpob.

264
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,560
If we stay in different time zones,
it's hard to find time to talk to each other.

265
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,120
Most couples break up because of the long distance.

266
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,360
Some couples can make it work, some can't

267
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,600
In my case, I had to break up with him
because he went to study abroad.

268
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,680
Many couples I know also broke up
because of the long distance.

269
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,720
What they had built together came to an end

270
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,080
as well as all the good moments they had together.

271
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,320
When I knew that my boyfriend
had to work in a faraway city,

272
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,120
I told him we should take a break in the relation.

273
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,360
We didn't know what would happen in the future.

274
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,120
I think this is better to protect both of us
from getting hurt.

275
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,440
Sorry, I'm late. Have I kept you waiting long?

276
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
No.

277
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
I thought I had kept you waiting.

278
00:28:29,157 --> 00:28:31,000
You look exhausted.

279
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,560
A bit.

280
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,080
I had to meet my relatives today and it was hard
to excuse myself and get out of there.

281
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,480
It's been hectic lately,
I didn't even have time to think.

282
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,760
And the travel date is coming near.

283
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,240
I was afraid I couldn't see you before I go.

284
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,040
Do you know why I asked you to meet me here?

285
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,705
Whenever I think of it,

286
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,160
this place is full of good memories of us.

287
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,880
Our journey from the beginning until now...

288
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,800
So I want to spend one more time
with you here before I go.

289
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,600
And in the next two years,

290
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,840
let's come back here
and revive memories of us together.

291
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:21,109
I love you.

292
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,160
Kongpob, I think...

293
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,440
Are you okay, Arthit?

294
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,360
I think...

295
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,160
we should take a break in our relationship.

296
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
Why?

297
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,080
What happened? You can tell me.

298
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,120
When we are apart,

299
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,406
we won't be able to talk as much as before.

300
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,080
Our love...

301
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,800
will fade away bit by bit.

302
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,984
We will begin to pick a fight.

303
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,480
The memories we had together...

304
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,240
are really good.

305
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,240
Really, really good.

306
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,160
I don't want to fight with you.

307
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,297
I want to keep all the good memories of us.

308
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,101
Would it be better...

309
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,133
if we pause our relationship here?

310
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,400
One more thing.

311
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,240
You are over there.

312
00:31:08,692 --> 00:31:10,212
If you are sick,

313
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,500
or go through any hardship,

314
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,600
I can't be there.

315
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:22,307
I can't be there with you.

316
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,163
Would it be better if we...

317
00:31:27,163 --> 00:31:29,003
Have you thought this through?

318
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,480
What do you think?

319
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,480
If you know that we have to end
our relationship one day anyway.

320
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
Wouldn't it be better to end it here?

321
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,523
If I think that we will break up one day,

322
00:31:50,523 --> 00:31:53,160
I will make every second between us count.

323
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,800
I will cook for you until our last day together.

324
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,280
I will do everything...

325
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,615
I will do everything to show you how much I love you.

326
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,341
So that on the last day I won't feel regret.

327
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,880
If that day has to come,

328
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,920
I will just smile at you and go.

329
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,370
No matter what happens,

330
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,640
I will always love you.

331
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,400
Tomorrow, I will go through
the entrance gate at 7.00 o'clock.

332
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,167
I will wait for you.

333
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,520
Kong, your flight is early
in the morning tomorrow, right?

334
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,960
Well, I don't think I can go see you off now.

335
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,483
So sorry, but I just realized
I have to go to the countryside tomorrow.

336
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:25,963
And none of us seems to be available
to see you off.

337
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,120
It's okay. No need to say sorry.

338
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,950
Anyway, May. Can I ask something?

339
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:38,908
Sure.

340
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,160
When M told you
he would go abroad to further his study,

341
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,594
what did you feel?

342
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,040
Well... I, actually, didn't want him to go,
but I didn't say what I felt to him.

343
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,040
All I could do was just support him
and be happy with him.

344
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
How are you and M now?

345
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,080
We don't get to talk much.

346
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,600
M is busy with his study and adjusting himself there.

347
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,640
But we talked and we thought
if we are meant to be with each other,

348
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,000
we will finally be with each other.

349
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,360
So we don't worry too much.

350
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,000
Okay... thanks.

351
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
No worries.

352
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,760
Kongpob, it's time to go inside.

353
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,600
Then, I should get going now.

354
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,240
Goodbye Dad, Mom. Bye, Gift.

355
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,400
Have a safe trip, dear.

356
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,400
Can I hug you, Dad?

357
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,843
Good luck, son. Have a safe trip.

358
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,680
Have a safe flight.

359
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
Good luck.

360
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,680
What did you just say?

361
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,000
I just make you my wife.

362
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,200
Kongpob!

363
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,960
Run around the field 54 times. Go!

364
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,480
Next time if you want to cry, tell me.

365
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,040
I will wipe off the tears for you.

366
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,040
Kongpob!

367
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,080
You study and work really hard.

368
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,400
Don't forget to look after yourself.

369
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,640
From now on,

370
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,120
the gear doesn't represent my heart only because
it means two connected hearts between us.

371
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,680
Ai-oon,

372
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,520
I love you.

373
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,880
No matter what happens to our love in the future,

374
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,040
but right now,

375
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,360
I'm happy.

376
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,120
Kongpob and I...

377
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,480
we are dating.

378
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,760
Kongpob, I have a question for you.

379
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,280
Are you ready for our future?

380
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,160
You never know
when it will be the last hug with someone.

381
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,560
Are you crying?

382
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,760
What a cry baby!

383
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,960
Arthit.

384
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,963
Well, Kongpob. I'm sorry for being late.

385
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,240
You know well that this bad habit of mine
is hard to break.

386
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,680
You come here to see me off.
This makes me happy enough.

387
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,760
Kongpob,

388
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,720
I'm sorry that
I wasn't sure of our relationship earlier.

389
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,800
But from this moment on,
I will believe in what you said to me.

390
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,040
I will make every second of us count.

391
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,360
Hey! Kongpob.

392
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,941
We are at the airport. Enough.

393
00:38:57,941 --> 00:39:00,520
Stop it.

394
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,800
I thought I wouldn't get to see you again.

395
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,360
Arthit, I have something for you.

396
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,720
What is it? When did you get it?

397
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,240
I have it with me because
I'm sure you will come to see me off.

398
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,963
But you cried. Do you want me to believe that?

399
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,763
So how do you know that I would be here?

400
00:39:28,763 --> 00:39:33,080
You told me you would be
the last person to see me off.

401
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,040
You have a good memory.

402
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,160
Give me your hand.

403
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,480
Hey, Kongpob. I think it's weird to...

404
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,840
How is it?

405
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:09,960
This "Sun" is mine. I have reserved it.

406
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You are incredible.

407
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,680
Come over here.

408
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,400
Do you think you are the only person
who has prepared something?

409
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,160
I have prepared something too.

410
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,720
Here.

411
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,560
Is this real?

412
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,200
You are not kidding me, right?

413
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,400
Why would I do that? It's what you see.
Let's get going now.

414
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:28,443
Do you know before I could get this ticket,
I had to clear all of my work in a short time?

415
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,280
Hello, how are you doing?

416
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,840
You must have been missing me.

417
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,440
I miss you, Arthit.

418
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,640
Arthit, I have an exam today. I need your support.

419
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,240
Do your best. Come back fast,
I'll have a reward for you.

420
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,920
Arthit.

421
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,920
Wake up or you'll be late for work.
