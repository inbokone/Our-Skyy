Where are you now, Pick?

3
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,604
Rome, sorry I'm late. The traffic was really bad.

4
00:01:17,604 --> 00:01:20,004
Let's float a "krathong" together now.
(A flower decorated floating vessel, celebrated similar to the Chinese Lantern Festival)

5
00:01:20,817 --> 00:01:24,760
I don't have any krathongs to float. They have been sold out since 6:00 p.m.

6
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,520
Never mind. Let's float a lantern instead.

7
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,942
Hey, kiddo.

8
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:34,482
Come here.

9
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,640
I want one. How much is it?

10
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,160
500 baht.

11
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,100
500! Isn't it overpriced?

12
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:53,107
Keep the change.

13
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,480
Let's go.

14
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,500
Let's float the lantern.

15
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,600
Are you mad?

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,300
You are silent again.

17
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,880
Don't be silent. Say it.

18
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,140
You are late. You didn't text me back. We didn't get to float the krathong.

19
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,490
You should have bought the krathongs if you knew they would be sold out.

20
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,720
You didn't reply to my message. How could I know you would be this late?

21
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,183
I thought we could choose the krathongs together.

22
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:31,543
I was working.

23
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,359
Why do you have to work this hard? You are not even in debt.

24
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:36,702
I am here now.

25
00:02:36,702 --> 00:02:39,385
Don't make it a big deal. I'm tired.

26
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:42,680
A big deal? Are you saying I'm blowing it out of proportion?

27
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,382
Yes. Or else you wouldn't be this upset.

28
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:46,842
But you have ruined my plan.

29
00:02:46,842 --> 00:02:48,001
What plan?

30
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,780
Will you die if we float this lantern instead of the krathong?

31
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,440
Fuck!

32
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,240
Let's get a new one.

33
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,847
I'm not going to float it now. I want to go home.

34
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,320
Hey, aren't we supposed to eat after this?

♫ An overcast sky, the sky is like this ♫

39
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,040
♫ It's lonely every time I look at it ♫

40

♫ (My heart has disappeared) The thunder rolls, raindrops fall, it's late ♫

41
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,450
♫ The more anxious I am, the more confused I get ♫

42
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:03,040
♫ Thinking of that person, the person who used to be right here ♫

43
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,500
♫ Thinking of every moment that I saw the vast sky ♫

44
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:16,140
♫ Thinking of that person who used to reciprocate my love,
who just left me ♫

45
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:21,010
♫ I'm regretting that I don't have you today ♫

46
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,800
♫ I want to do everything, I want to do it all ♫

47
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,390
♫ If it's just enough to have that hope that I can have those days back ♫

48
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:36,200
♫ Those good days, I want you by my side ♫

I will put it where it used to be.

53

00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,540
Okay.

62
00:06:57,093 --> 00:07:01,140
What are you doing? Aren't you afraid of being seen?

63
00:07:02,477 --> 00:07:04,140
I just need to grab my phone.

64
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,420
Why do you always have a dirty mind?

65
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,480
Yes, I do.

66
00:07:13,397 --> 00:07:17,680
Take care. See you at 6:00 p.m.

Hello, Good and Pao.

Hello, Rome.

Hey! That tickles!

I missed you so badly.

71
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,220
Come on, Pao. Stop teasing him.

72
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,999
Look at him. He's so adorbs.

73
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:54,642
Our customers always ask for him.

74
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,505
He's popular.

75
00:07:56,505 --> 00:07:59,088
But he's good at making coffee.

76
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:01,288
I am good at that, too.

77
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,520
Hey, Good.

78
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,280
I really am good at making coffee.

79
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,600
Why are you smiling like that?

80
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,170
I got it.

81
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,200
- Rome, am I good at making coffee?
- Yes.

82
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,360
See? Rome also agrees.

Hey, Pick.

84
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,283
Why are you working so hard that you just have time to eat?

85
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:30,126
Leave me alone, bro.

86
00:08:30,126 --> 00:08:33,937
You asshole, I was concerned about you.

87
00:08:33,937 --> 00:08:35,380
What cases do we have today?

88
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,400
Today? Just normal ones.

89
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,700
There are some dogs, cats, lions, zebras, hippopotamuses...

90
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,920
Stop fooling around.

91
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,940
Stop!

92
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,560
Hey, I forgot to tell you guys. I have a date tonight. I need to get off early.

93
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,640
Can I go, too? I'm really sleepy today.

94
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,546
What? Why don't we close early today? I want to get off early, too.

95
00:08:56,546 --> 00:08:59,660
Do you also have a plan? Who are you going with?

96
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,460
No one. I'll just finish this lunch and get back to work.

97
00:09:04,297 --> 00:09:06,492
Who is your date? Admit it. Where are you going?

98
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:09,252
Just doing my work.

99
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:11,399
Let's get going. He's keeping a secret from us.

100
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,220
It's nothing.

101
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,160
Pao, let me help.

102
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,200
Look.

103
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,140
Adjust the light down.

104
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,803
Yes, the picture looks way better.

105
00:09:36,803 --> 00:09:39,053
It's 5:00 p.m. May I leave first?

106
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:40,980
Sure. Of course.

107
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,660
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

108

I'm getting off first, Good.

109
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,223
Why are you leaving early today, Rome?

110
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:54,677
Do you have a date?

111
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,300
Yes.

112
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,513
Float a krathong for me, too.

113
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:00,313
Sure.

114
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:06,163
- Lie down, kitty.
- Let us check.

115
00:10:06,163 --> 00:10:08,346
Is he going to be okay?

116
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:12,297
Yes, he is. He is jumpy, but he's strong and won't die soon.

117
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,520
Are you crazy?

118
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,537
- Stay still, sweetie.
- Stay still. Or else, I'll eat you alive!

119
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:22,252
Are you going to eat him alive?

120
00:10:22,252 --> 00:10:23,875
No, I'm just hungry.

121
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:27,220
I'll eat him later. No, I mean I'll eat something later.

122
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,780
Stay still. He's giving you a vaccine.

123
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:36,702
Hey, didn't you say you wanted to get off early, too?

124
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:40,844
I'll be out soon. I want to finish this first.

125
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:43,900
What about you? Didn't you have a date?

126
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,340
I already did. I'm fetching something here and going home.

127
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:49,977
What? What time is it now?

128

[10:00 p.m]
Fuck.

129

I've got to go now. See you later.

130
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,363
What's going on? What's the rush?

131
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,660
What's with him?

132
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,820
Is she dead?

133
00:11:17,806 --> 00:11:19,406
Rome!

134
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,260
Fuck.

135

Let's get a new one.

136
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:43,780
I'm not going to float it now. I want to go home.

00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:37,574
Fuck.

141
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:01,207
Our bodies got switched?

142
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,774
How could this happen, Pick?

143
00:14:05,774 --> 00:14:07,554
I don't know.

144
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,684
Ouch. What are you doing?

145
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:17,167
I was just checking if we were dreaming.

146
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:19,219
Why don't you pinch yourself?

147
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:24,089
I forgot.

148
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:27,139
What should we do now?

149
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,940
What's up, Shorty?

150
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,444
This is strange. It's like I'm talking to myself.

151
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:45,060
I do look really cute.

152
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,720
That's why you like me.

153
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,260
Come on. We should think of a way to reverse this.

154
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,620
Stop it.

155
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,800

Rome, stop walking around.

00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,960
Pick, what made our bodies switch?

158
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,380
Did we eat something weird yesterday?

159
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,760
- Hey, I think it's a chemical in our brains that's not functioning properly.
- What are you getting at?

160
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,080
Our bodies are not switched, but our brains are making us think they were switched.

161
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,240
You got a point.

162
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,800
Or it's the law of gravity.

163
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,680
We are together every day, so we switched our bodies.

164
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,483
Pick, it's almost time to go to work.

165
00:15:57,483 --> 00:16:00,723
Let's think of a way to switch our bodies back.

166
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,540
Pick!

167
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:16,208
I have an idea how to switch our bodies back.

168
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,740
Are you ready, Pick?

169
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,240
How about this? Let's go back to sleep.

170
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,563
We probably woke up in our dream.

171
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:04,560
Like in the movies, a dream inside a dream.

172
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,040
- Like Inception?
- Yes.

173
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,379
Go back to sleep.

174
00:17:34,532 --> 00:17:36,100
Pick...

175
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,280
Let's hug.

176
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,700
Tighter.

177
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,480
Isn't it tight enough?

178
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,120
Pick, hold on.

179
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:14,136
Isn't it the time for that?

180
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:17,960
I don't mean to. It's just up by itself.

181
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,520
Come here.

182
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,683
What should we do now? I have a penguin case this afternoon.

183
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,540
I have to go to the café, too.

184
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,440
We have to go to work while our bodies are switched like this?

185
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,800
Yes, I guess so.

186
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,520
Let's try to figure out how to switch back later this evening.

187
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,320
Yes, Pick.

188
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,120
There's one more way we can go now. Do you want to give it a try?

189
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,160
What is it?

190
00:19:12,037 --> 00:19:15,260
So? Does it work?

191
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,640
Pick, why is there water here?

192
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,820
Great, my neighbors are washing themselves in their front yard.

193
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,932
- They even take off their tops. What showoffs!
- Can you toss my shoes back?

194
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,710
Hurry up! Why are you hesitating?

195
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:14,420
What the hell?

196
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,143
Get in the car.

197
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,043
Why is it so hard? I can barely see the front.

198
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,120
Don't exaggerate, Pick.

199
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,890
I'm just teasing you.

200
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,940
Let's get going.

201
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,720
Are you sure you can drive?

202
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,840
Yes.

203
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,260
It's been a while, but I think I can manage.

204
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,783
Why didn't you drive from the start? I had to fix the rear-view mirror for a while.

205
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:27,380
If I told you, you would ask me to drive, so I kept my mouth shut.

206
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,520
Drive carefully.

207
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,774
Fuck!

208
00:21:34,821 --> 00:21:36,442
What are you doing?

209
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,756
Just kidding you.

210
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,816
Don't ask for trouble, Shorty!

211
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,160
Take care of my body.

212
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,880
Bye.

213
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,160
What will I have to go through today?

214
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,880
- How are you doing, babe?
- Hey!

215
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,900
Who the fuck is your babe?

216
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,886
Rome, did you get home late last night after floating the krathong?

217
00:22:16,886 --> 00:22:18,922
You came here late today.

218
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,826
Rome.

219
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,460
My duty is to scoop ice cream. Right?

220
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,760
We don't serve ice cream here.

221
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:42,360
How about you make coffee today?

222
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,520
It's Saturday. We have a lot of customers in the house now.

223
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,660
Coffee?

224
00:22:55,117 --> 00:22:56,800
Do you find him strange today?

225
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,620
Yes, he almost hit me earlier.

226
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,020
You probably teased him too much.

227
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,043
I do that all the time. How come he got worked up about it today?

228
00:23:05,043 --> 00:23:07,263
Where's the coffee machine?

229
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,000
[Animal Hospital]

230
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,080
It's almost lunchtime and you just got here.

231
00:23:51,478 --> 00:23:53,598
Hello, Jay.

232
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,880
Hello, Neung.

233
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,620
Why are you so polite today?

234
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,720
Polite?

235
00:24:04,237 --> 00:24:06,440
Am I fucking polite?

236
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,340
That's more like the old Pick.

237
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,680
Where's Pick's room?

238
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,920
Oh, here it is.

239
00:24:26,357 --> 00:24:28,720
He must have gone demented.

240
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,283
Look at him. You probably made him work too hard.

241
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,520
It's my fault.

242
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,720
Maybe he hasn't had enough sleep.

243
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:42,160
Didn't you order latte?

244
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,570
Large ice, vanilla latte, skimmed milk, extra shot,

245
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,940
and no whipped cream.

246
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,335
So, you want one coffee.

247
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:31,366
Hey, Pick.

248
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,560
The owner of Penguin case is here.

249
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,340
Okay.

250
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,740
- Hurry up.
- Hold on—

251
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,440
Hurry. Don't make them wait.

252
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,740
It's not nice of you to do this with me.

253
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,720
Doing what?

254
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,840
Pinching my cheek.

255
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,940
You are a woman. You must be careful.

256
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,768
Come on.

257
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,800
We are friends.

258
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,260
Yes, and you shouldn't do this with anyone.

259
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:12,540
If people see this, they will get the wrong idea about Pick.

260
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,700
Are we clear?

261
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,320
Let's go. Let's do our beloved job.

262
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,820
By the way, is Penguin the name of a dog or a cat?

263
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,600
It must be a cat.

264
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,000
Let's get going.

265
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,370
What? It's a real penguin?

266
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,280
I thought it was a name.

267
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,260
Yes, in the flesh.

268
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,820
Pick, how did it go today?

269
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,889
So damn boring.

270
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:48,412
It's much more comfortable being around cats and dogs.

271
00:26:48,412 --> 00:26:52,075
People are demanding. Can't they have just a simple coffee?

272
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,280
What happened?

273
00:26:57,739 --> 00:26:59,905
How is the penguin?

274
00:26:59,905 --> 00:27:02,045
I let Jay take care of the case.

275
00:27:02,568 --> 00:27:04,268
Good move.

276
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,260
Yes, Pick.

277
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,160
I had a dream about a little boy last night.

278
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,560
I also had a dream about a boy.

279
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,360
The boy who sold the lantern to us.

280
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,640
The boy who laughed in the corner of the bedroom.

281
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,040
He wore a colorful necklace.

282
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,980
Holy fuck!

283
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,636
That bloody boy could be the one who switched our bodies.

284
00:27:31,636 --> 00:27:33,936
Call him nicely.

285
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,460
Let's go back there. We may get something.

286
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,800
It was here.

287
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,510
Come out, lantern boy!

288
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,353
Pick, take it easy.

289
00:27:45,353 --> 00:27:47,314
We don't have time to take it easy.

290
00:27:47,314 --> 00:27:49,694
Come out, you ghost boy!

291
00:27:51,343 --> 00:27:53,426
Ghost boy, where are you?

292
00:27:53,426 --> 00:27:55,026
Pick!

293
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,620
Where is he?

294
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,060
Ghost boy!

295
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:22,800
Pick, who is laughing?

296
00:28:24,949 --> 00:28:26,652
Am I too loud?

297
00:28:26,652 --> 00:28:29,693
Sorry, this drama is hilarious.

298
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,520
Can you keep it down, lady?

299
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,660
You two are in each other's body.

300
00:28:49,907 --> 00:28:50,870
Pick.

301
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,170
Are you looking for someone?

302
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:58,255
It doesn't concern you.

303
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,120
Are you looking for a little boy?

304
00:29:03,386 --> 00:29:05,729
Don't listen to her. She's just blabbing.

305
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:08,749
You two had your bodies switched, right?

306
00:29:10,877 --> 00:29:12,750
How did you know?

307
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,953
Do you know how to switch back?

308
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,567
- Yes.
- How?

309
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:18,813
5,000 baht.

310
00:29:18,813 --> 00:29:20,360
Let's go.

311
00:29:20,964 --> 00:29:23,143
Easy. 1,000 baht will do.

312
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:34,000
I'll kick your ass if you play a prank.

313
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,200
Come on. I won't do that.

314
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,620
These are the stones of fate.

315
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:46,700
If you two can touch the same stone with your heart

316
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,397
without saying a word,

317
00:29:48,397 --> 00:29:52,117
your fate will go back to normal.

318
00:29:59,177 --> 00:30:01,780
But if you touch different stones,

319
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,800
your fate will go wrong for eternity.

320
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,020
Go ahead.

321
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,180
Make it right.

322
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,793
Damn.

323
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:36,393
Take them.

324
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,660
Gosh, she's really fast.

325
00:30:48,316 --> 00:30:51,216
Don't pick the wrong stones!

326
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,163
On my count, let's touch the stone together.

327
00:31:02,163 --> 00:31:03,905
Close your eyes.

328
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:07,145
1... 2... 3.

329
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,302
Let's do it again.

330
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,120
1... 2... 3.

331
00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:23,940
All right. Let's see if we can do it one last time.

332
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,420
1... 2...

333
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,700
This is a bummer.

334
00:31:31,537 --> 00:31:34,437
Do I have to be like this for the rest of my life?

335
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,840
It's a bummer to make that stupid coffee.

336
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,920
It's a bummer to be someone else.

337
00:31:46,534 --> 00:31:49,634
Is it that bad to be me?

338
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,950
It's not bad, but I don't like it.

339
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,330
Do you actually enjoy being like this?

340
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,840
I didn't say that I like being like this.

341
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,420
But I would try to be you as best as I can.

342
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,320
I will do my best every day. That's all.

343
00:32:09,946 --> 00:32:13,766
Then, be me. Be me for the rest of your life.

344
00:32:52,717 --> 00:32:56,620
Pao, go talk with him.

345
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,140
Nah, he may snap back at me.

346
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,940
His mood lately is not the Rome we used to know.

347
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,580
Why don't you go talk with him?

348
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,800
Yes.

349
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,220
Go.

350
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,540
Rome.

351
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,000
Is there anything bugging you?

352
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,794
If it's about the café, you can tell me.

353
00:33:30,794 --> 00:33:32,434
Okay.

354
00:33:36,961 --> 00:33:40,614
Hey, do you still have the burn from the hot water yesterday?

355
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,760
I got burned yesterday. It can't be cured quickly, right?

356
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,760
You are wrong, Good.

357
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,011
I remember he got burned on the left hand.

358
00:33:51,011 --> 00:33:53,709
While he tried to practice his latte art,

359
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:56,977
he accidentally poured hot milk on his hand.

360
00:33:56,977 --> 00:33:59,400
You should have taken care of him better.

361
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,840
Don't just take care of girls.

362
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,260
Why do you look so dreamy? Did you have a fight with your date?

363
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,460
Did Pick tell you he was seeing someone?

364
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,930
You never told us.

365
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:21,520
Even so, I can tell that you are seeing someone.

366
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,060
Is it that obvious?

367
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,820
Yes, it is.

368
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,920
Whenever I ask you to hang out with me after work, you always refuse.

369
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,500
Nueng invited you to play football and eat, and you also refused.

370
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,060
You just say that you like to be at home.

371
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,563
I'm not a kid.

372
00:34:39,563 --> 00:34:43,723
If there's no one there, you wouldn't want to be home that badly.

373
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,363
Look, he's smiling.

374
00:34:49,363 --> 00:34:52,263
So, what is the fight about?

375
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,500
Nothing. Just a fortune teller. It's not important.

376
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,920
Fortune teller?

377
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,360
Don't worry about that too much.

378
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,010
If something is bound to happen, it will happen.

379
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:05,080
Just do your best.

380
00:35:05,797 --> 00:35:07,890
Bringyour date to see us, too.

381
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,460
I want to know if she is as pretty as me.

382
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,660
Jay is way uglier.

383
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,720
What are you laughing at?

384
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,880
What the fuck are you laughing at?

385
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,140
Pick.

386
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,380
Did you burn yourself?

387
00:35:57,977 --> 00:35:59,920
Be more careful.

388
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,163
Pao broke the steam wand. I got burned once.

389
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,440
Apply this balm.

390
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,180
I'm sorry about what I said yesterday.

391
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,980
It's okay. I'm not mad.

392
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,380
But can I ask you one thing?

393
00:36:34,397 --> 00:36:36,740
Why do you have to work this hard?

394
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,620
You too.

395
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,200
Why didn't you just focus on studying and finish your last year?

396
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,060
Why do you waste your time at this stupid café?

397
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:47,800
Look at your hands. There are many burn marks.

398
00:36:48,899 --> 00:36:50,900
Can you quit?

399
00:36:53,600 --> 00:37:00,020
I keep working because I see you working so hard.

400
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,980
I don't know why you work that hard to save your money.

401
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,220
But I don't want you to be tired anymore.

402
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,580
I just think...

403
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,580
if one day...

404
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,660
my father sees that I can stand up on my own,

405
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,200
our future...

406
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,120
What is our future?

407
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,040
Why?

408
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:03,057
You're not going to tell me.

409
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,180
Pick...

410
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,700
Thank you.

411
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,300
What's wrong? What are you thinking?

412
00:38:32,204 --> 00:38:34,464
Let's say...

413
00:38:35,353 --> 00:38:38,715
that fortune teller is a fraudster.

414
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,780
Even if we pick the same stone, we won't go back to our own bodies.

415
00:38:45,388 --> 00:38:47,621
It's going to be okay.

416
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:50,087
You are a smart person.

417
00:38:50,087 --> 00:38:54,967
I'm sure you can find a way for us to switch back.

418
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:02,689
I mean...

419
00:39:03,485 --> 00:39:06,185
even if we can't find a way to switch back,

420
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,840
at least we get to be together.

Be careful when removing it when talking to anyone. I don't want myself to have a bad image.

434
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,700
Remove it for me.

Go brush your teeth.

436
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,500
Go and brush your teeth and I'll remove it for you.

437
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,280
Pick, go and brush your teeth.

438
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,840
Let's try again, Pick.

439
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,203
Yes, we picked the same stone.

440
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:54,803
Yes!

441
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,060
If you are in your own body tomorrow,

442
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,680
stay away from Pao.

443
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,920
If I see him trying to flirt with you, I will smack him.

444
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,600
You will smack Pao?

445
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,240
No, I will smack you.

446
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,757
- Are you jealous?
- No.

447
00:41:14,757 --> 00:41:16,520
Give me your cheek.

448

00:41:29,325 --> 00:41:31,205
I need to kiss you.

451
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,520
You've got chills?

452
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,280
Do you have a hard on?

453
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,880
Don't push me.

But why are we old?

462
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,938
You picked the old man stone, Shorty.

463
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,880
You also picked it.

464
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,580
I don't know. We must pick again tonight.

465

Don't pick that, I beg you.

Don't talk about it.
