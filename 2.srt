00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,820
The place.

168
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,320
What about the person?

169
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,140
Which person?

170
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,060
The person who is very close to you right now.

171
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,460
You mean Toey?

172
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,101
Very very close.

173
00:22:13,101 --> 00:22:16,103
That's still Toey.

174
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,760
In.

175
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,430
In.

176
00:23:13,107 --> 00:23:14,823
In!

177
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,778
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

178
00:24:19,778 --> 00:24:21,440
Please come again.

179
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,240
- Thank you.
- See you again.

180
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,323
Ah, tonight I will spend the night over the reservoir.

181
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:31,403
If you don't want to go,
I can take you back to the city.

182
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:35,669
How could I don't want to go?
I will follow wherever you go.

183
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,760
I told you. You can't escape from me.

184
00:24:41,308 --> 00:24:42,308
Toey!

185
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,655
Can I please the driver on our way back?

186
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:48,994
If I sit at the back,

187
00:24:48,994 --> 00:24:51,063
I get dizzy.

188
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,396
Up to you.

189
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:58,035
It's good for me too. Sitting is better than driving.

190
00:25:59,113 --> 00:26:00,778
Just park here.

191
00:26:00,778 --> 00:26:02,113
- Right here?
- Yeah.

192
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,236
Sun.

193
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:28,764
Let's go.

194
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,963
Let me.

195
00:27:04,963 --> 00:27:06,603
This is the best it can hold.

196
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,280
Ouch.

197
00:27:23,678 --> 00:27:24,838
Are you bleeding?

198
00:27:25,754 --> 00:27:28,480
You should have been more careful.

199
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,520
Let me see.

200
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,003
I'm fine.

201
00:27:31,003 --> 00:27:32,203
Wipe with this.

202
00:28:08,613 --> 00:28:09,853
Where are you going?

203
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,400
To take photos of sunset.

204
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:17,240
Do you want me to go with you?

205
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,520
That's totally up to you.

206
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,880
You walk too fast.
Do you want me to go with you?

207
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,960
- I don't care.
- You don't act normal.

208
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,840
Tell me if you want me to go with you or not.

209
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,560
I don't know. You're gonna fall.

210
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
Don't walk so fast. Walk slowly.

211
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,819
Want me to go together with you? Tell me.

212
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:38,684
- I don't want to say it.
- Don't want to say what?

213
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:09,960
♫ I hear you asking so many people ♫

214
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,640
♫ what is love like? ♫

215
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,720
♫ Today you can't answer ♫

216
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,560
♫ all the lies that everyone says about us ♫

217
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:31,560
♫ may make you feel uncertain ♫

218
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,280
♫ Please don't try to find what love is ♫

219
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,680
♫ If you feel it then it's there in your heart ♫

220
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,960
♫ Trust your own feelings for once ♫

221
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,920
♫ Like my love, ♫

222
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,883
♫ it says to me to have you ♫

223
00:29:46,883 --> 00:29:50,120
♫ and I should have only you ♫

224
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,480
♫ and I should have only you ♫

225
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,920
♫ This is the only reason I like to assure you ♫

226
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,200
♫ that I love you ♫

227
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,169
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

228
00:30:10,573 --> 00:30:12,621
Beautiful, isn't it?

229
00:30:18,675 --> 00:30:20,583
This angle is better.

230
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,283
Hey, let me take it for you.

231
00:30:30,283 --> 00:30:31,630
- No.
- It's fine.

232
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,190
- No, please.
- Don't be so stubborn. Hurry.

233
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:45,203
- Be careful.
- I'm not gonna fall.

234
00:30:45,203 --> 00:30:49,800
- You're so stuffed.
- Hurry up, it's so high.

235
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,240
Smile. 1, 2...

236
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,724
Wait.

237
00:30:52,724 --> 00:30:53,764
Your hair.

238
00:31:05,751 --> 00:31:07,471
Don't look at me like that, In.

239
00:31:09,261 --> 00:31:10,861
Why can't I?

240
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
Hold on.

241
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:21,109
Can we talk nicely for a sec?

242
00:31:46,592 --> 00:31:48,192
I miss that trip.

243
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:52,051
The trip we went together.

244
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,645
We went there by train.

245
00:31:57,645 --> 00:31:59,955
Our school trip when we were in Grade 11.

246
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,360
Sawasdee krap.

247
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,213
My name is Akin Ruengtakul.

248
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,800
I'm a new student. This is my first day.

249
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,588
Please advise me.

250
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,659
Why did you enjoy bullying me?

251
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,237
I don't know.

252
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,963
You are too cute, I guess.

253
00:32:31,877 --> 00:32:33,437
I already know that.

254
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,043
But you know something?

255
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:42,043
You are not a lovely person at all.

256
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,520
But you still like me.

257
00:32:51,693 --> 00:32:53,760
That's true.

258
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,400
Actually, I should have hated you.

259
00:32:59,906 --> 00:33:01,346
I know, right?

260
00:33:02,253 --> 00:33:03,453
Then, why?

261
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,303
When you like someone, you don't need a reason.

262
00:33:27,949 --> 00:33:30,143
If I could turn back time,

263
00:33:32,989 --> 00:33:34,709
I would still bully you.

264
00:33:36,804 --> 00:33:38,448
Because you are a bad person.

265
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,852
If we talked nicely back then,

266
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,440
it might not turn out like this.

267
00:33:51,653 --> 00:33:53,653
I missed you really much, Sun.

268
00:34:13,917 --> 00:34:15,117
Yes, Toey?

269
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,523
Damn. We are up this high.
How could there still be a signal?

270
00:34:20,523 --> 00:34:22,323
What network does he use?

271
00:34:23,597 --> 00:34:27,284
Yes, I'm here to take pictures. I'll get back shortly.

272
00:34:29,805 --> 00:34:30,885
Okay.

273
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,960
Wait, Sun.

274
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,240
Can we stay here for a little while?

275
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,188
How did you find this place?

276
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,852
Do you know Google?

277
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,160
Don't bug me.

278
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,625
I don't know who I got it from.

279
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,200
♫ One day I went into the woods ♫

280
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:44,840
♫ I met a bird and it asked me where I was going ♫

281
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:50,387
♫ I said I wanted to go to a faraway place, ♫

282
00:35:50,387 --> 00:35:54,727
♫ the farthest place I had ever been ♫

283
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,000
♫ Oh oh ♫

284
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,960
♫ Oh oh ♫

285
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:10,760
♫ If I am weary I will go into the woods ♫

286
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:18,120
♫ at least, I don't have to see someone
who is mean like you, ♫

287
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:25,480
♫ who is cold and heartless to
the person who once loved you ♫

288
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:31,160
♫ A mean person like you
deserves to be left alone ♫

289
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:39,160
♫ When you feel really lonely,
you may get back to me ♫.

290
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,640
How was it, Toey?

291
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,960
Nice choice of song.

292
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,400
Absolutely.

293
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,648
Toey.

294
00:36:48,648 --> 00:36:50,843
You don't have a lover yet?

295
00:36:50,843 --> 00:36:53,285
That's private. Why are you trying to pry?

296
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:56,019
Why?

297
00:36:57,108 --> 00:36:58,518
I can't ask you?

298
00:36:59,747 --> 00:37:01,787
Now... no.

299
00:37:03,144 --> 00:37:04,400
But I'm waiting.

300
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:06,644
Maybe soon.

301
00:37:09,433 --> 00:37:12,042
How did you become close with Sun?

302
00:37:12,042 --> 00:37:15,187
We often traveled to take pictures together.

303
00:37:15,187 --> 00:37:17,253
And we have a lot in common.

304
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:19,434
Like...

305
00:37:19,434 --> 00:37:21,378
About five or six times already right?

306
00:37:22,811 --> 00:37:23,949
That many times?

307
00:37:24,885 --> 00:37:27,560
Or was it more than that?

308
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,000
It's so often I lost count.

309
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,520
Sun, can I have your guitar?

310
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,487
- You know how to play?
- Yes.

311
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,991
♫ Honestly speaking, I'm upset ♫

312
00:37:55,991 --> 00:37:59,342
♫ that you bring him here with you ♫

313
00:37:59,342 --> 00:38:02,795
♫ Honestly speaking, I'm not happy ♫

314
00:38:02,795 --> 00:38:06,280
♫ Honestly speaking, I'm not happy ♫

315
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:13,335
♫ Even though you say he's not important ♫

316
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:20,757
♫ but the look in your eyes say otherwise ♫

317
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:27,040
♫ I fear that you will get shaken
as he is in your life ♫

318
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:34,880
♫ The more I see you talk to him,
the more I know you love to be with him ♫

319
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,960
♫ I fear of what he might think of you ♫

320
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:48,680
♫ I fear of losing you to him
The more I think, the more I feel hurt ♫

321
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,960
♫ I don't want him to be there next to you ♫

322
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,520
♫ Every time I see you with him ♫

323
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,160
♫ I feel like I could die in front of you, so please ♫

324
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:09,773
♫ please don't make me paranoid any longer
if you still care for me ♫

325
00:39:09,773 --> 00:39:16,320
♫ Can you not see him ever again? ♫

326
00:39:56,948 --> 00:39:58,933
Why give it to me if you are cold?

327
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,706
To keep you warm.

328
00:40:03,246 --> 00:40:05,035
Or you want me to hug you instead?

329
00:40:05,902 --> 00:40:07,238
Don't talk nonsense.

330
00:40:09,445 --> 00:40:13,888
You walked away from Toey
because you want me to come after you, right?

331
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:30,773
Why are you doing this, In?

332
00:40:30,773 --> 00:40:32,519
Then, why are you avoiding me?

333
00:40:33,774 --> 00:40:36,404
You intend to cut me out of your life.

334
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:37,884
But I can't seem to avoid you anyway.

335
00:40:43,627 --> 00:40:45,107
Then, don't avoid me.

336
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:48,886
Can't we be like before?

337
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:52,171
I'm tired of being your love advisor.

338
00:40:55,072 --> 00:40:58,192
I don't want to be involved in your relationship
with any of your girlfriends.

339
00:41:00,102 --> 00:41:06,253
I already told you that I could not stand
to stay like this with you.

340
00:41:07,728 --> 00:41:09,964
I want to know where I stand...

341
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:17,591
because I don't think of you as just a friend.
Don't you understand?

342
00:41:18,717 --> 00:41:21,320
Sun, calm down first.

343
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,650
How many time have you been like this
for the past three years, In?

344
00:41:29,057 --> 00:41:30,800
Try to be in my shoes.

345
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,205
Do you have to do this?

346
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,137
You are really a jerk.

347
00:41:40,137 --> 00:41:42,920
If I'm a jerk, you might as well hate me.

348
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,683
If I can hate you, I would.

349
00:41:44,683 --> 00:41:46,508
What do you want me to do? Tell me.

350
00:41:56,552 --> 00:41:58,032
Be my boyfriend.

351
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,200
But I'm not forcing you.

352
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,480
If you don't want to,

353
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,000
there is someone waiting for me.

354
00:42:17,152 --> 00:42:18,472
You should bear that in mind.

355
00:43:02,098 --> 00:43:04,098
Can you see the stars like this in Bangkok?

356
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,560
There are too many neon lights there, right?

357
00:43:15,964 --> 00:43:18,832
So you can't see anything good there.

358
00:43:18,832 --> 00:43:20,832
It's not the time to be cool, seriously.

359
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,040
I feel pity for you.

360
00:43:26,085 --> 00:43:27,760
You can say anything because you won.

361
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:32,640
You came a long way...

362
00:43:34,122 --> 00:43:35,882
just to give up easily?

363
00:43:40,507 --> 00:43:41,680
You know something?

364
00:43:43,628 --> 00:43:47,984
It's really a wonderful thing
when you realize who you love.

365
00:43:51,665 --> 00:43:55,785
But someone chooses to deny it...

366
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,920
with some reason that has nothing to do
with his own feelings.

367
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,800
Sun must really like you.

368
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,480
Love does make people stupid.

369
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,480
Think carefully.

370
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,000
Here you go. I brought you warm water.

371
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,520
Thank you so much.

372
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,419
What is it this time?

373
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,200
Everything.

374
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,760
Sun,

375
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:26,520
certain people need to be stimulated
to make them see the valuable thing they have.

376
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,280
But I'm not that valuable.

377
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,223
If In had thought the same as me,

378
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,800
he would probably want to be together
with me a long time ago.

379
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,400
But...

380
00:45:51,437 --> 00:45:52,840
Forget it.

381
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,160
He will go back tomorrow. It will be end.

382
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,044
Can you end your feeling with him?

383
00:46:05,077 --> 00:46:08,224
No matter how hard you try to run from it, you can't.

384
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,800
It hurts so much.

385
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:51,167
I am sorry.

386
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,469
Come on.

387
00:46:54,461 --> 00:46:57,480
I'm okay. You don't need to worry about me.

388
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,520
I know from the start that, no matter how hard I try,

389
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,932
I can't make you not think of me as a big brother.

390
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:08,510
That's not true.

391
00:47:09,865 --> 00:47:14,283
If I don't have In, I would probably be with you.

392
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,200
You don't like an uncle with a beard like me.

393
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,880
I think your type is a big bulky guy, right?

394
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,520
Don't be ridiculous, Toey.

395
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,360
Don't worry.

396
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,400
With my handsome face,
I won't be heartbroken for too long.

397
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,040
Thank you.

398
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,960
Enough, I might can't hold it.

399
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,280
I am your little bother.

400
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,760
The person who gave you the scarf
is probably chilling to death.

401
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,720
Let's go find him.

402
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:30,853
Toey, In is not back yet.

403
00:48:30,853 --> 00:48:32,912
Where could he be?

404
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,400
It's late now. What should we do?

405
00:48:47,797 --> 00:48:49,160
He turned off the phone.

406
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,812
Let's split up to search for him. It's getting colder.

407
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,080
Wait, Sun.

408
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,920
Take care of yourself.

409
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,920
Yes.

410
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
In.

411
00:49:15,769 --> 00:49:17,400
In.

412
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,847
In, are you here?

413
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:24,027
In.

414
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,360
What prank are you playing?

415
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,240
In.

416
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:33,844
In.

417
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:39,726
In.

418
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,200
In.

419
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,080
What prank are you playing?

420
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:00,716
I...

421
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,560
I just wanted to see the stars clearer.

422
00:50:08,322 --> 00:50:09,562
But look,

423
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:13,729
the batteries are dead.

424
00:50:13,729 --> 00:50:14,849
I can't go back.

425
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,360
What a loser.

426
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,160
Yes.

427
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,880
I'm really a loser.

428
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,840
I cannot get anything done.

429
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:36,619
I wanted to reconcile with you and I failed.

430
00:50:43,178 --> 00:50:46,301
I wanted to cut tie with you and I failed too.

431
00:50:53,569 --> 00:50:55,289
I'm sorry.

432
00:50:57,778 --> 00:51:01,018
I didn't realize I have been really selfish with you.

433
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:04,613
Now you know.

434
00:51:08,169 --> 00:51:09,529
Yes, I know.

435
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,960
Then,

436
00:51:12,942 --> 00:51:14,672
you must compensate me.

437
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,080
Compensate?

438
00:51:19,931 --> 00:51:23,811
You want me to take you back from Toey?

439
00:51:25,172 --> 00:51:27,040
You will never know if you don't try.

440
00:51:34,102 --> 00:51:39,614
Whether you manage to steal me from Toey or not,

441
00:51:39,614 --> 00:51:41,200
I'll be the one who decides.

442
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,479
Can you tell me now how you feel about me?

443
00:52:04,546 --> 00:52:06,186
I...

444
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,200
I love you, Sun.

445
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,280
So?

446
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,920
I won't lose you to anyone again.

447
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,563
If people ask about our relationship,
what will you say?

448
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,120
I will say that we are a couple.

449
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,454
Do you dare to admit that?

450
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,320
Up until now,

451
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,520
I don't understand myself. I'm not sure
what I'm afraid of or what I'm waiting for.

452
00:52:55,531 --> 00:52:58,231
You know what you want pretty late.

453
00:52:58,231 --> 00:52:59,360
I should just smack...

454
00:53:00,997 --> 00:53:02,280
Do you dare?

455
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,280
Do I dare?

456
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,680
Are you cold?

457
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,766
We can stay warm together.

458
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,440
I...

459
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,094
I love you, In.

460
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,329
I have known that for a long time.

461
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,280
Long time?

462
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,360
Really long time.

463
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,520
For how long?

464
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,160
Toey.

465
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,120
Toey.

466
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,440
Toey.

467
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:51,960
Sun, all pictures are saved in here.
Submit them for the contest.

468
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,160
You can find your way back to the city, right?

469
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,163
Have a quality time with him.

470
00:54:56,163 --> 00:54:57,357
Bearded Uncle.

471
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:24,400
In, if you can't take care of Sun well enough,
I will take him back.

472
00:55:28,494 --> 00:55:30,857
He's In, the person I told you about.

473
00:55:30,857 --> 00:55:32,497
This is him?

474
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,000
I'll help you.

475
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,640
- You sure?
- Yes.

476
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,087
Love each other as long as you can.

477
00:55:58,087 --> 00:56:01,800
Don't worry about me, I can find a way
back to where I was.

478
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,400
P.S. Sun is not as weak and gentle as you think he is.

479
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,520
Be careful. He's a badass.

480
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,520
Toey.

481
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:16,520
Why does he say here that I should be careful of you?

482
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,755
You are a badass.

483
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,320
Don't be paranoid. I'm this cute.

484
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,849
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

485
00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:28,320
Are you planning to pull my leg?

486
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,353
No, I'm not.

487
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,353
Come on. Let's pack our stuff.

488
00:56:33,128 --> 00:56:35,128
- You are suspicious.
- Don't be ridiculous.

489
00:57:01,185 --> 00:57:03,200
1... 2...

490
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,520
I miss my friends.

491
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,080
Oh, Pete and Ainam.

492
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,840
Ainam...

493
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,240
Yes, she sent a postcard to me.

494
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,320
She sent one to me too.

495
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,760
She's really a wingwoman.

496
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,280
She's been trying to hook us up since high school.

497
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,520
"Hurry and end up together already,
it's a waste of time."

498
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,240
She doesn't know that we have done more than that.

499
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,920
You are really a badass.

500
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,585
Let me read your postcard too.

501
00:58:08,517 --> 00:58:10,277
Give it to me.

502
00:58:10,277 --> 00:58:12,152
Come on, let me see too.

503
00:58:12,152 --> 00:58:15,160
It's personal stuff. It's a secret.

504
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,920
Hey, we are a couple. There should be no secret.

505
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,566
Wait.

506
00:58:19,566 --> 00:58:21,920
I haven't agreed to be your boyfriend.

507
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,360
It's all in your head.

508
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,360
It's all in your head, dude.

509
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,600
This is how you want to play?

510
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,240
Come back here, Sun.

511
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,400
- I can't hear you.
- No, you hear me.

512
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,320
I have changed my name. I should get going now.

513
00:58:36,793 --> 00:58:40,753
So if you win the photo contest, who will you go with?

514
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,560
Of course, I will go with Toey.

515
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,320
Hey, what about me?

516
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,360
I don't know.

517
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,281
- How could you do that to me?
- I don't know.

518
00:58:52,281 --> 00:58:54,960
- No, you must take me with you.
- No.

519
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,040
- You must take me with you.
- Beg me.

520
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,360
Please let me go with you.

521
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,800
Beg more.

522
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,243
- Please let me go with you.
- More.

523
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,080
What do you want to eat?

524
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:13,040
Pork BBQ, chicken rice, pad thai, mussel pancake.

525
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:16,360
You can eat all that when we are in the city.

526
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,720
Toey should not have left us.

527
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,323
- I hear the sound of a car.
- A car is coming.

528
00:59:26,538 --> 00:59:27,840
Will we get hit?

529
00:59:34,597 --> 00:59:36,400
Where are you two going?

530
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,163
We want to go back to the city center.
Are you going through there?

531
00:59:40,037 --> 00:59:42,360
Yes. Yes. Get in the car.

532
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,402
- Thank you so much.
- Wait a minute.

533
00:59:44,402 --> 00:59:47,082
What relationship do you two have?

534
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,720
He's my boyfriend. We are dating.

535
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,720
See? I told you.

536
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,840
Get in. We will drop you in the city. I'm a fan of BL.

537
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,000
Thank you very much.

538
01:00:09,335 --> 01:00:10,695
They are nice.

539
01:00:57,757 --> 01:01:02,120
It's our 3rd anniversary.
I want to do something special for him.

540
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,590
- Test his feeling?
- Yes. Let's test his feeling.

541
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:07,000
Trust me. This is the best way.

542
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,040
[True love needs to be tested]

543
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,651
On one condition, don't tell anyone.

544
01:01:11,651 --> 01:01:13,627
Gosh, hug me too.

545
01:01:13,627 --> 01:01:16,840
Damn it. Don't tell anyone.

546
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,159
Mork!

547
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:20,802
He didn't text me back. He replies to Nuknik only.

548
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:21,921
Nuknik who?

549
01:01:21,921 --> 01:01:24,720
A fake chat ID I created to test him.

550
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,203
[What a cute name.]
[Let me see your photos.]

551
01:01:26,203 --> 01:01:29,840
Woah, he's pretty chatty.

552
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,640
Mork, you fool!

553
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:34,000
[Stop testing or stop seeing each other for good?]

554
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,240
You want to test him and end up getting jealous?

555
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,200
Do you think I'm a kind person?

556
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,403
Are you sure? Don't let me find out
that you take someone home.

557
01:01:56,403 --> 01:01:58,683
Come on. No such thing.
